# Date Class Project

## Project Overview
This Java project implements a `Date` class to handle date-related operations with the following features:
- **Date Validation**: Checks if a date is valid, including leap year handling for February.
- **Date Operations**: Update dates, calculate days between dates, and determine the day of the week.
- **Sorting Support**: Enables sorting of `Date` objects by year, month, and day using `Collections.sort()`.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid date inputs.

Key functionalities demonstrated in the `Main` class include:
- Creating valid/invalid date objects.
- Calculating the day of the week for April 6, 2025 (Sunday).
- Computing the day difference between April 6, 2025, and January 1, 2026.
- Sorting a list of dates from 2025.
